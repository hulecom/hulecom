# Hulecom GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I develop work-related and personal projects.

## Work Topics
I am working on satellite gravimetry using GRACE and GRACE Follow-On products. As a geodetic nerd, gravimetry goes hand in hand with geodetic reference frames and positioning in my book ðŸ˜Ž !

I have developped a new Python librairy for gravity-field operations LEGOS that uses xarray to perform similar tasks. See [Lenapy](https://www.github.com/CNES/Lenapy) !
