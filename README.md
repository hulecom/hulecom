# Hulecom GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I develop work-related and personal projects.

## Work Topics
I am working on satellite gravimetry using GRACE and GRACE Follow-On products. As a geodetic nerd, gravimetry goes hand in hand with geodetic reference frames and positioning in my book ðŸ˜Ž !

During my PhD at Strasbourg, I contributed to the [Gravity Toolkit](https://github.com/tsutterley/gravity-toolkit) repository.

I am currently preparing a new Python library at LEGOS that uses xarray to perform similar tasks. Stay tuned for updates !
